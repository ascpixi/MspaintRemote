# MspaintRemote
A C# library to remotely control Microsoft Paint instances through raw memory read/writes. You can see it in action, playing Bad Apple, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RU41Z5PzrA)!

> [!NOTE]
> I made this on a whim in one day, and so, this probably has lots of undiscovered bugs and missing features. If you actually do need to remotely control paint for some crazy project of yours, give me a nudge, and I'll be happy to have an excuse to work on this silly little project again! (¬‿¬)
